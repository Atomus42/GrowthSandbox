---

### FIX-08: "day 1" should be capitalized in hero section

**Location:** Homepage > Hero section > second paragraph

**Location:** Homepage > About / Company Foundation section

**CURRENT:**
```
By 2025, 80% of pharma will have adopted AI benefit-risk-enabled solutions.
```

**REPLACE WITH:**
```
According to IDC, AI-powered benefit-risk solutions are now a top strategic priority for life sciences organizations worldwide.
```

---

---

## PART 3: CONTENT IMPROVEMENTS (not bugs, but recommended changes)

These are not errors but improvements that strengthen the site.

---

### IMPROVE-01: Add source citations to statistics

**Location:** Homepage > "The Benefit-Risk Evaluation Challenge" section

**CURRENT:**
```
With 9 out of 10 drugs failing (57% efficacy issues, 17% safety concerns) at an average cost of $2.3B per approval
```

**REPLACE WITH:**
```
With 9 out of 10 drugs failing (57% efficacy issues, 17% safety concerns) at an average cost of $2.3B per approval (Source: Tufts CSDD, 2020)
```

---

### IMPROVE-02: Clarify "18 months" claim

**Location:** Homepage > Challenge section > "Time-Consuming Manual Analysis"

**CURRENT:**
```
Traditional benefit-risk assessments can take up to 18 months per drug, delaying critical go/no-go decisions and market authorization filings.
```

**REPLACE WITH:**
```
Full benefit-risk assessments across the drug lifecycle can span 12-18 months, while individual PSUR/PBRER cycles alone take 12-16 weeks. Each cycle is a manual, resource-intensive process that delays critical go/no-go decisions and market authorization filings.
```

---

### IMPROVE-03: Clarify performance metrics baselines

**Location:** Homepage > Step 3 metrics

**CURRENT:**
```
60% faster evaluation time
9x more insights detected
70% cost reduction vs. CROs
```

**REPLACE WITH:**
```
60% faster evaluation time vs. traditional manual processes
9x more safety signals detected
70% cost reduction vs. traditional CRO engagements
```

---

### IMPROVE-04: Strengthen hero tagline

**Location:** Homepage > Hero section > tagline

**CURRENT:**
```
Trusted by Pharmaceutical Leaders
```

**REPLACE WITH:**
```
Trusted by 20+ Pharmaceutical Leaders Across 50+ Regulatory Submissions
```

---

### IMPROVE-05: Remove redundant "Founded in 2018" in Science section

**Location:** Homepage > "The Science Behind the Platform" section

**CURRENT:**
```
Founded in 2018 by a team of pharmacoepidemiology experts, ArcaScience was built to solve a $13 billion market problem: the lack of comprehensive, real-time benefit-risk intelligence.
```

**REPLACE WITH:**
```
ArcaScience was built to solve a $13 billion market problem: the lack of comprehensive, real-time benefit-risk intelligence.
```

(The founding date is already mentioned in the About section above. No need to repeat it.)

---

### IMPROVE-06: Add partner logos to social proof section

**Location:** Homepage > below hero or testimonial section
**Issue:** Only Sanofi is referenced. If other partnerships are confirmed, add their logos.
**Action:** Add a logo bar with confirmed partners (e.g., AstraZeneca, GSK, Takeda, ICON, Paris Brain Institute). This is not a text fix but a design/component addition.

---

### IMPROVE-07: Add hero stats bar

**Location:** Homepage > directly below the hero headline
**Issue:** Key numbers (100B+ data points, 24 AI models, 50+ submissions, 20+ clients, 12 therapeutic areas) are scattered through the page.
**Action:** Add a horizontal stats bar component with these 5 numbers displayed prominently. This is not a text fix but a design/component addition.

---

### IMPROVE-08: Strengthen testimonial attribution

**Location:** Homepage > Testimonial section

**CURRENT:**
```
Global R&D Team, Sanofi
```

**Action:** If authorized by the client, replace with a named attribution such as:
```
Dr. [Name], VP Pharmacovigilance, Sanofi
```
Confirm with the Sanofi contact which level of attribution is approved.

---

### IMPROVE-09: Add company stats to About section

**Location:** Homepage > "Built by scientists. Trusted by pharmaceutical leaders." section
**Action:** Add a stats row with the following data points:
```
60+ Team Members | 15+ Nationalities | 2 Offices (Paris & Sunnyvale) | Backed by The Moon Venture, Pleiade Venture, Plug&Play, Bpifrance
```

---

### IMPROVE-10: Meta description update

**Location:** HTML `<meta name="description">` tag

**CURRENT:**
```
AI-powered benefit-risk decision engine for pharmaceutical drug safety and regulatory compliance. Supporting 50+ regulatory submissions across 12 therapeutic areas since 2018.
```

**REPLACE WITH:**
```
ArcaScience: AI-powered benefit-risk analysis platform for pharma. 24 proprietary models, 100B+ data points. Trusted for 50+ FDA/EMA/PMDA regulatory submissions across 12 therapeutic areas.
```

---

### IMPROVE-11: Remove single-review schema markup

**Location:** HTML structured data / JSON-LD schema
**Issue:** Rating 5/5 based on "1 review" looks artificial to Google.
**Action:** Either remove the `aggregateRating` block entirely, or wait until you have genuine aggregated reviews (G2, Capterra, etc.) before adding it back.

---

## PART 4: TECHNICAL FIXES

---

### TECH-01: SPA routes return 404 on direct access

**Location:** Server configuration
**Issue:** Navigating directly to `/about`, `/team`, `/faq`, `/use-case`, `/vision`, `/publications` returns 404.
**Action (pick one based on your hosting):**

**If Vercel** - add to `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

**If Netlify** - create `public/_redirects`:
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

**If Nginx** - add to server block:
```nginx
location / {
    try_files $uri /index.html;
}
```

---

### TECH-02: Add accessibility page

**Location:** Footer > Legal links
**Action:** Add an "Accessibility" link in the footer legal section, pointing to a page that states your WCAG 2.1 AA compliance commitment.

---

### TECH-03: Verify social media profiles

**Location:** Footer > Social links
**Listed:** Instagram, X.com, LinkedIn
**Action:** Click each link and verify the profiles exist and are active. Remove any links to empty or inactive profiles. Consider removing Instagram if it has no content (unusual for B2B pharma SaaS).
